node-red-contrib-wws
=====================

A set of node-red nodes to interact with [IBM Watson Workspace](https://workspace.ibm.com/).

# Purpose
This node is intended to be used for communicating with the Watson Workspace APIs using [Workspace Apps](https://developer.watsonwork.ibm.com/docs/get-started/what-can-you-build). 

Once you have created a Workspace App, you can create the corresponding "NodeRed Configuration node" representing this app.
With these nodes, you have the ability to configure webhooks, to send messages or files to spaces to which the corresponding Workspace App is attached, to execute [graphQL commands](https://developer.watsonwork.ibm.com/docs/developers-guide/graphql-api), to create and update spaces based on Templates, to get information about the Focus assigned to a given message and to add custom Focus, to filter "ActionSelected" annotations and Webhook events.

Here is the list of Nodes currently proposed by this package.

Full documentation, including sample NodeRed flows using these nodes, is available in the Documentation Directory of the [corresponding Github repository](https://github.com/stefanopog/node-red-contrib-wws/tree/master/docs)

# Installation

## Automatic Installation
This packages installs using the standard **Manage Palette** feature in the NodeRed interface.

## Prerequisites
The following packages are required to be present in node-red prior to this installation
* `"body-parser": "^1.18.2"`
* `"simple-oauth2": "^1.5.2"`
* `"javascript-state-machine":"^3.0.1"`
* `"follow-redirects":"^1.3.0"`
* `"request-promise-native": "^1.0.5"`
* `"request": "^2.87.0"`


## Manual Installation
* In case of manual installation copy the code to the user directory of Node-RED e.g. `/data/node_modules/node-red-contrib-wws`.
* Install the dependencies via npm install and move packages one level up `mv node_modules/* ..Â´.
* To make Node-RED find the code, define the NODE_PATH environment variable by adding the Node-RED installation directory first, and the user directory second. Here is an example: `NODE_PATH="/usr/src/node-red/node_modules:/data/node_modules"`

# Features
## Credentials node
  * creates a configuration node for a dedicated Watson Work Application, 
  * containing App ID and App Secret, 
  * plus additional OAuth configuration elements
  * Note : **this node is used by all the other nodes**
  * Note : **This nodes currently supports ONLY Authorization as app**

## Webhook node
  * Configure the webhook url
  * converts events into node-red friendly messages
  * shows incoming events on nodes status
  * attaches details of the *original message* for **Annotation** and **Reactions**
  * optionally provides filtering of outputs according to the **event type** received by the webhook

## Send message node
  * send messages to a space
  * provides a configuration interface (including preview functionality)
  * selection of available spaces
  * availability to upload a profile photo for each app
  * returns response from WWS to msg.payload

## Get message node
  * Gets all the information from a given message, including **Annotations** and **Reactions**

## File node
  * selection of available spaces
  * either sends a file (of any kind) or an image (png, jpeg or gif) to a space

## GraphQL node
  * static or dynamic GraphQL query 
  * return node-red friendly results.
  * supports **BETA** and **EXPERIMENTAL** APIs

## Filter Actions node
  * this is a service node which makes it easy to filter Annotations coresponding to **actionSelected** lenses
  * you can specify multiple **ActionId** (they can come from *custom intents*, from *slash commands*, from *buttons* etc)
  * provides multiple outputs. Each output corresponds to one of the possible **actionId** that the instance of the node supports

## Filter Annotations
  * This node provides a convenience to separate Annotations (coming from the **Webhook** node) in order to assign different processing
  * It provides a convenience to select a subset of NLP annotations

## Get (Templated) Space node
  * this node simply retrieves all the information related to a standard space or to one that was built out of a Template
  * It friendly provides textual representation of **preperties**, **property values** and **status**

## Update Space
  * This node provides a tool to easily update a Space coming from a Template. It allows to easily change the **status** and any of the **properties**.
  * The main characteristics of this node is that the **names** and the **values** of the **properties** and of the **status** are entered using their textual representation.
    * New Property values are specified using a comma-separated string where each item is in the form of a *name = value* pair

## Space From Template
  * This node provides a tool to easily create a Space from a Template. It allows to easily initialize any of the **properties** coming from the Template and the **initial members**.
  * The main characteristics of this node is that the **names** and the **values** of the **properties** are entered using their textual representation.
    * New Property values are specified using a comma-separated string where each item is in the form of a *name = value* pair
  * This node **ONLY WORKS WITH an AUTHORIZE-AS-USER**, i.e. using the "wwsToken" input parameter

## Get Template
  * This node provides a tool to easily retrieve all the informations from a Template.
  * This node **ONLY WORKS WITH an AUTHORIZE-AS-USER**, i.e. using the "wwsToken" input parameter

## Add/Remove Members
  * This node provides a tool to easily add or remove Members to or from a Space. More than one member can be added or removed at the same time.

## Get Person(s)
  * This node provides a tool to easily retrieve all the details for a set of people.
  * The set of people can be specified as a set of comma separated **email addresses** or "**IDs**"

## Get Focus
  * This node provides a tool to easily invoke the **Focus API** to retrieve inforrmations about the Focuses that the system assigned to a given message.

## Add Focus
  * This nodes provides a tool to easily add a new, custom Focus to an existing message

## Action Fulfillment
  * The node provides a convenience tool for creating Action Fulfillment **Attachments** and **Annotations** and to execute the relevat GraphQL mutation.
  * It works in conjunction with information that are passed by the previously described **Webhook** node.
